<h2> MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS </h2>
<p><h3> In this wepage you'll be able to see some different kind of musical instruments and also know about them. <br>
    but before that, what are musical instruments? </h3>
    A musical instrument is a device created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered
    a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. A person who plays a musical instrument is known as an instrumentalist.
    The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for rituals,
    such as a horn to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies
    for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications and technologies. <br>
    Musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years.
    Instruments can be classified by their effective range, material composition, size, role, etc. However, the most common academic method,
    Hornbostel–Sachs, uses the means by which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology. </p>

<p> The piano is a stringed keyboard instrument in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material
    (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys
    (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.
    It was invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700. </p>

<h2> <a name="#gtr"> Guitar </a> </h2>

<p>  The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming
     or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand.
     A plectrum or individual finger picks may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically,
     by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier. </p>

<h2> <a name="#dms"> Drums </a> </h2>

<p>  The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone.
     Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands,
     or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound. There is usually a resonant head on the underside of the drum. Other techniques have been used to cause
     drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained 
     virtually unchanged for thousands of years. </p>

<h2> <a name="#tru"> Saxophone </a> </h2>
<img src="saxo.jpeg" height = 300 width = 300>
<p>  The saxophone (referred to colloquially as the sax) is a type of single-reed woodwind instrument with a conical body, usually made of brass.
     As with all single-reed instruments, sound is produced when a reed on a mouthpiece vibrates to produce a sound wave inside the instrument's body.
     The pitch is controlled by opening and closing holes in the body to change the effective length of the tube. The holes are closed by leather pads
     attached to keys operated by the player. Saxophones are made in various sizes and are almost always treated as transposing instruments.
     Saxophone players are called saxophonists.
